A live demo of the system can be found [here](https://school-management-68caf.web.app/).

## Technologies Used

- [Angular](https://angular.io/): Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform for authentication, data storage, and hosting.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/): Design tool used for prototyping and designing the user interface.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): Frontend framework for responsive design and UI components.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): Icon library used for UI icons.

## Installation

To run the system locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/school-management-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd school-management-system
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

Before running the system, you need to configure Firebase:

1. Create a new Firebase project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Enable Email/Password authentication in the Authentication section.
3. Set up a Firestore database to store student, teacher, course, and other relevant data.
4. Copy your Firebase configuration credentials.
5. Create an environment file (e.g., `environment.ts`) in the `src/environments` directory with your Firebase configuration.

   ```typescript
   export const environment = {
     production: false,
     firebase: {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
     }
   };
   ```

## Usage

To start the system locally, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The system will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.
